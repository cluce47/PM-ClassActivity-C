Prototype:
The prototype was well made and displayed the answers.

Algorithm:
The algorithm could have had the way to figure out the answer and more thought to it.

Code:
The code could have used the calculations it had to print the answers instead of having a series of unused calculations. 
It is user friendly by giving user the proper input it requires however it could be improved by removing unnecessary calculations 
and printing the answers from a calculations instead of having an "empty" calculation.
