This program does NOT work. The variable being checked does not change and so the loop never ends, meaning it is a broken 
program that does not run properly and therefore, can't be released.

SUCCESSES: It is organized nicely.
PROBLEMS:Code doesn't work, no commenting, original code forgot brackets

It is user friendly if it had worked. It still is organized nicely. 

To improve the code, the while condition has to be changed to stop it from looping infinitely. More testing and a check of the
logic and syntax will make the code work.

There is documentation missing from the entire program that makes the program harder to understand for other coders.
